"""Sequential invoice numbering (`INV-<year>-<seq>`, per org per year) —
deliberately separate from common/codegen.py's `generate_unique_code`, which
derives a code by slugifying a name (fits Course/Group, not a monotonic
invoice sequence). Locks the org's existing rows for the year with
`select_for_update` inside the caller's transaction so two concurrent
invoice creations for the same org can't race onto the same number.
