"""Explicit audit-log writes for the four CLAUDE.md-mandated categories
(auth, payment, role-change, deletion) — deliberately not generic
post_save/post_delete signals on every model. See plan §5 for why: login/
logout aren't model saves at all; soft-delete is itself a .save() so a naive
signal can't distinguish it from an ordinary field update; and blanket
per-model logging would log far more than CLAUDE.md actually asks for.
